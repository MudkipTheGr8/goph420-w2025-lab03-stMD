# Love Wave Dispersion Analysis - GOPH 420 Lab 03

Python code that performs root finding using Modified Secant Method. This code provides information that can be analyzed from seismic theory.

Surface Waves and Love Waves are investigated in this lab, specifically the dispersion equation for Love Waves in a two-layer system where a single surface layer is overlying an infinite half space layer.

The main code is within love_wave_analysis.py this is where the code should be run. This file uses the function in the solving_roots.py file.

Steps to run Code:
Clone repository
1.) git clone https://github.com/MudkipTheGr8/goph420-w2025-lab03-stMD
Create a virtural environment
2.) python -m venv nenv
Install packages
3.) python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Main Script
4.) python love_wave_analysis.py
